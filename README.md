# LeetCode ? Full Markdown & Jupyter Notebook

*A focused companion for documenting problems, preserving attempts, and exporting shareable notebooks.*

## Overview
LeetCode ? wraps each problem page with a lightweight workspace: one click gathers a polished Markdown snapshot and an executable Jupyter notebook. It keeps track of custom runs, surfaces your recent submissions, and packages everything into a format you can review, study from, or share with teammates.

## Highlights
- **Rich summaries in seconds** – copy a neatly formatted Markdown report that captures the full description, glossary notes, test cases, and recent submissions.
- **Ready-to-run notebooks** – export a `.ipynb` file that opens with a shared harness and your latest code, so you can continue experimenting offline.
- **Custom run awareness** – the toolbar badge reminds you when the current problem already has captured inputs from the Run button.
- **Gentle UI** – a compact floating toolbar keeps actions within reach without interfering with solving.

## Getting Started
1. Install your favourite userscript manager (Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, or similar).
2. Add the `LeetCode ?` userscript from this repository.
3. Visit any LeetCode problem or contest page and allow the toolbar to appear at the bottom-right corner.

## Daily Workflow
- Click **Copy Report** to place a complete write-up on your clipboard. Paste it into notes, pull requests, or study journals.
- Choose **Save .ipynb** to download a notebook containing the description, harness, and recent solutions.
- Use **Copy Log** if you want a quick diagnostic snapshot while debugging.
- Look for the badge to confirm whether custom inputs from the Run button have been captured for this problem.

## Tips for a Smooth Experience
- Run at least once before copying or saving so custom input is included.
- Keep the problem page open until the notebook download finishes.
- If you rearrange the toolbar, the position persists between sessions.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Does it work on both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn?**  Yes. Problem and contest pages on either site are supported.

**Will it change my submissions?**  No. It only reads data already available in the page and formats it for export.

**Is any information sent elsewhere?**  Everything stays in your browser. The tool simply organises what LeetCode already provides.

## Thanks
LeetCode ? started as an evening productivity experiment and has grown through feedback from solvers who wanted better notes, richer discussions, and smoother handoffs. Enjoy the workflow and keep shipping solutions!
